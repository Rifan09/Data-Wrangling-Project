 - ### Data Gathering:
The data is collected from open sources available on the internet, such as Kaggle, One Data Portal, and UCI Machine Learning Repository. After obtaining the data, it is imported from CSV to a data frame using the Pandas library in Google Collaboratory.

- ### Data Assessment:
At this stage, the data in the data frame is assessed to check for missing, inaccurate, or duplicate data.

- ### Data Cleaning:
This stage involves cleaning the data to ensure its accuracy and consistency. After completing the data assessment stage, proceed to clean the assessed data.
